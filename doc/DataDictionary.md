## Introduction


The purpose of this document is to describe the main fields associated with the TTC Subway API. It also translates the fields Line ID, Station ID, and `station_char` from IDs to values that will make sense to a TTC transit user.

| container   | stationid           | ID referencing a particular station (e.g. Union) and subway line (e.g. Yonge University yellow line). | 2                   | This is the ID entered when requesting data from the API. Most subway stations only have one station ID. However, some may have two. For example, Bloor-Yonge station has two station IDs, one for the BD green line and one for the YUS yellow line.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                 |
| container   | lineid              | ID referencing the subway line that the incoming train is travelling on.                              | 1                   | This is the ID entered when requesting data from the API. For stations with multiple lines (eg Bloor Yonge), the API will return not only train data for the lineid requested but also for the other subway lines at the station. Thus, lineid is not a reliable field for determining which line an incoming train is traveling on. Use the subwayline field instead. There are three subway lines in the data: 1, 2, and 4 corresponding to YUS, BD, and SHEP.  |                                                                                 |

## Data Mapping for Line ID and Station ID 

Note that some station names have two Station IDs. For example, Bloor-Yonge has IDs 22 and 50. ID #22 corresponds to the Yonge-University line whereas ID #50 corresponds to the Bloor-Danforth line.

## Data Mapping for `station_char`

In the data, some station_char values are associated with 2 station IDs and line IDs. This is because when we request data from the API for a station that is part of multiple subway lines, it returns trains details for all subway lines.  

N = North, S = South, E = East, W = West and refers to the direction the train travels.

Note that this excludes station_char values for the new station IDs (75-80).
